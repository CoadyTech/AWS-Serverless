<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an example implementation of a 'serverless' contact form, for use on the AWS Cloud. It's great for static websites that just need that extra bit of functionality.  

Why serverless? Here's why:
* No need to setup, configure or maintain a web server and associated scripting languages (e.g. PHP, Node.js, etc.).
* Scale-able. From one hit per day, to 100 per hour, AWS manages everything automatically.
* Cheap or free :smile:
